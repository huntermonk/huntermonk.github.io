title:  "Interest rate arbitrage. ðŸ’¹ (1/3)"
---

# Plan
I tweeted [that I want to take advantage of the interest rate spread on crypto lending](https://twitter.com/huntermmonk/status/1356693024177229824). Basically, get a cheap loan somewhere, deposit it in a crypto savings account, and pocket the difference. 

This is [covered interest rate arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covered-interest-arbitrage.asp). Here's an example:

1. Take out a 100k loan at 2% interest.
2. Deposit in a savings account that pays 10%. Leave the 100k in there for a year, earning 10k.
3. Pay back the 2% interest on the loan, which is 2k.
4. I now have 108k.

# Current Positions

[Celsius](https://celsius.network/) pays 10% on the USD-pegged stablecoin, USDC. From Interactive Brokers, my blended collateralized interest rate is 1.423%. That difference is of course, **8.577%**.

Because I have 150k in [Interactive Brokers](https://interactivebrokers.com/), and it requires 50% collateral, I have a loan of 75k. Fidelity's terms are 40k loan at 4%.

On my Fidelity account, it's 4%. 

I've compiled the results in a Google Sheet that is embedded here:

# Current Results
They're not great. After-tax, I'm getting $18,807.41 on $309,562.99 invested, or a 6.076% annual return. While very low risk, still not fantastic.

The last column shows the profits if the company doing this arbitrage was headquartered in Puerto Rico, where the [corporate income tax rate is 4%](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-puertoricohighlights-2020.pdf).

That is $26,093.86 on $309,562.99 invested, or a 8.43% annual return. 39% better.

# Risks

This is a very low risk strategy compared to investing in stocks, bonds or crypto currency. However, there are risks.

**Platform Fail**

The main risk is that one of the lending platforms ([Celsius](https://celsius.network/), [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/), [Nexo](nexo.io)) folds / gets hacked and doesn't return funds to investors. They have significant insurance via their custodians; this will always be the risk the uninformed brings up, and the perceived risk is why there is still such a large interest rate differential. For those reasons I won't go deeper.

**Not Reading Contracts**

The other risk, which is purely executional risk, is making sure that:
1. There are no early repayment penalties on the loan.
2. There are no limitations to withdrawals from the lending platforms.

If #1 and #2 are true, then if the difference in interest rates collapse, the arbitrage can be covered before any losses incur.

**Taxes**

I need to shift this income to be for the business, not me, so that the cost of the interest is subtracted from the profit, and I'm only taxed on profit.

# Conclusion
Going to continue to see if I can find loans that are profitable and large enough. I would like for that interest to be shown as revenue for Hunter Monk LLC, which then allows more favorable loans.
