# Objective
I think Bitcoin will reach an all-time high (ATH) in the next 5-14 days because of the stimulus bill. 

I don't care about convincing anyone that; I just want a public record of what I believe. That way:

1. If I'm wrong, I'm forced to go back and address it. I figure out why I'm wrong, and improve.
2. If I'm correct, there's a public record of it.
3. This promotes a culture of accountability. (not being Jim Cramer making predictions nobody goes back and verifies)

# Context
This weekend, the [1.9 Trillion Stimulus Bill](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/05/stimulus-explainer-basics-checks-unemployment-taxes-spending/) was passed in the Senate. It seems likely that the House will vote it in as well.

A summary of the changes:

>## Unemployment benefits
>The package extends the existing $300 weekly unemployment benefit through Sept. 6, as well as provide a tax break on $10,000 in unemployment benefits.
>
>## Stimulus checks
>$1,400 stimulus check sent to anyone earning $75,000 per year or less.
>
>## Minimum wage
>A minimum wage increase to $15 was proposed, but *didn't pass*.
>
>## Child tax credit
>Most Americans receive $3,600 a year for each child under 6. $3,000 a year for children 6 to 17. This lasts for a year.
>
>## Aid to state and local governments
>Designation of $350 billion for states, cities, tribal governments and U.S. territories.
>
>## Pandemic response
>Tens of billions of dollars will fund coronavirus testing and contact tracing.

Because this money is being printed, this will devalue the US dollar further. Bitcoin is a common store of value alongside gold:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The stimulus bill passing will be recognized by large scale investors (banks, not BTC speculators).<br><br>On Monday, they will go back to the office and start purchasing; BTC price will rise immediately.</p>&mdash; Hunter (@huntermmonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/huntermmonk/status/1368268832658186240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The crucial point, is that we are at a tipping point for Bitcoin's adoption by mainstream financial services:

1. Tesla (world's most valuable carmaker, led by world's richest person) [bought 1.5B worth of Bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html).
2. In Nigeria, [Bitcoin is trading at a 46% premium](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-is-trading-at-a-46-premium-on-luno-nigeria-after-central-bank-ban).
3. JPMorgan now recommends private wealth clients [to own Bitcoin](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/97257/jp-morgan-bitcoin-deck-private-client).

Institutional investors are more likely to have planned responses to currency devaluation. Because of that, I think large, institutional-level buying will start this Monday 3/8/2021.
