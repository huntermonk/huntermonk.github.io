In March of 2021, I was on track for my goal of working 2,800 hours in 2021 as described in [part 3](https://huntermonk.com/2021/03/19/working-hard-pt-3.html).

Unfortunately, I ended short of my goal.

It was a fairly aggressive goal. I stop my timer if I take a phone call, make food, get mail, or anything not work related. Given that fairly strict definition of work, it is still a solid performance.

I will make my goal next year.

_Edit: The output in the picture doesn't quite make sense because I ran it on 1/2/2022 instead of during 2021. I worked 2,644.91 hours in 2021 - 155.09 hours short._
