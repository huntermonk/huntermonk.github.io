I was a guest on [Looking Backward](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/looking-backward/id1465612637?ign-mpt=uo%3D4)! Looking Backward is an interview-style podcast where [Chad Sakonchick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadsakonchick) interviews entrepreneurs about their past. He's looking for patterns that have led to their success.

Our episode focuses heavily on my early years, from 11 to 22 years old. I'm impressed with how it turned out. [Listen here.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hunter-monk-facebook-programmer/id1465612637?i=1000441801306)
