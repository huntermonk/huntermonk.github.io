title:  "How to start iOS contracting."

This is my most linkbait title yet.

I recently responded to a Reddit post where someone asked me how to get started conracting. These are my thoughts.

> So you make custom apps for people and bill them by the hour?

Yep, exactly. I can do fixed bids also, but that doesnâ€™t happen often for mobile apps.

> How do you find your clients? Word of mouth?

Yep, it's that mostly. Conferences, accelerators, etc. I've done one contract with Upwork and it was ok. Very low rates there though.

> Do you meet with the clients face to face or Skype/email?

I definitely prefer meeting face-to-face. Probably a third of my contracts are remote, but you just tend to not be as effective when remote.

> Do you ever get any uncooperative clients or does being freelance offer you the opportunity to pick and choose the good ones?

I do get uncooperative ones. About 3 weeks ago, I had to end the relationship with one of my clients. It was a good source of money, but his meticulousness (which is an asset for him) was too much pain for me.

> Any libraries or resources you would recommend someone interested in something like this?

I would just recommend starting coding. I started learning on [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com). Just start shipping products/side-projects so you have a portfolio, and the contracts will come.
