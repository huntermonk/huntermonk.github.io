title:  "Extreme candor."
---

After completing a proficiency test for a client, he gave me unemotional, accurate feedback. It was helpful to hear, and I could act on it in future work.

He ended our feedback conversation with something to the effect of:

> I hope that you and I can continue working in an environment with extreme candor.

I really like the phrase "extreme candor". Since that conversation, I've tried to apply extreme candor to all aspects of my life, not just business.

So far it has caused positive effects, but it's too early to tell.
