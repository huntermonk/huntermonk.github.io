title:  "Queue + Stack + Fibonacci Playground.⚽️"

As mentioned in [Interview Prep](../../../2018/11/01/interview-prep.html), I'm prepping for interviews with larger companies. I've been doing my algorithmic work in Swift Playgrounds on the iPad.

I'm sharing one of them today.

I'm posting this using an all-iPad flow. I'm using [Working Copy](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8), a git client, to post via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I'm in split-screen with git client on left and playground on right.

[This playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0QiNpjHw8nGYGHuLfIa9OQyrg#Queue_and_Stack) contains one page for queue, one for stack and one for Fibonacci.

If you tap the playground link on your iPad, it should open into Safari, then give you the option to open in Swift Playgrounds. I will post a video of the flow soon.

*This is a work in-progress. I can't preview Jekyll pages on iPad yet, so will have to commit and push to production.*
