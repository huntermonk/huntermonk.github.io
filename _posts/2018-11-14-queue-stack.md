title:  "Queue + Stack + Fibonacci Playground.⚽️"

As mentioned in [Interview Prep](../../../2018/11/1/interview-prep.html), I'm prepping for interviews with larger companies. I've been doing my algorithmic work in Swift Playgrounds on the iPad.

I'm sharing one of them today.

I'm posting this using an all-iPad flow. I'm using Working Copy, a git clients to post via Jekyll. I'm in split-screen with git client on left and playground on right.

[This playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0QiNpjHw8nGYGHuLfIa9OQyrg#Queue_and_Stack) contains one page for queue, one for stack and one for Fibonacci.

*This is a work in-progress. I can't preview Jekyll pages on iPad yet, so will have to commit and push to production.*
