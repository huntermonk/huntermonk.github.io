title:  "30 Day Office + Gym Challenge."
---

Today, I've started my 30 day challenge to go to my new coworking space, [NeueHouse](http://neuehouse.com), and the gym, every day.

The only requirement is that I enter the building. If I take one step in and leave, that's ok.

To keep myself accountable, I have to send my friend a picture from each space every day. If I don't send him my update, I have to donate $10 to the local homeless shelter. He has a set of tasks also and a similar charitable "punishment".

It feels a little silly setting all this up for such small tasks, but it will be a good accountability experiment.
