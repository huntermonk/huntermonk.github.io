title:  "Learning Computer Science. 👨🏼‍💻🧪"
---

I didn't do CS in college, I studied economics. Studying is a strong term - I didn't pay attention and dropped out when I was [awarded Student Entrepreneur of the Year](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/Three%20Honored%20at%20UT%20Entrepreneurship%20Awards%20for%202014%20-%20SiliconHills.pdf).

Not having a core of CS knowledge has hampered my productivity and career, in my opinion. I've been a professional software engineer for 5 years, but I've hit a glass ceiling as a product engineer.

To that end, on Tuesday, June 28th I'll start the [Bradfield CS _Computer Architecture and the Hardware/Software Interface_ course](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/architecture/). It's a short 10 week course. 

If it goes well and is sufficiently difficult, I'll continue to take their courses and possibly their [_Computer Science Intensive_](https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/); it's intended to be similar to a master's program.

I will update how this goes in subsequent posts.
