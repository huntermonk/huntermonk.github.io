This week, [Gamestop was the target of a short squeeze](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-25/money-stuff-the-game-never-stops) led by Redditors from [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/).

I joined on Tuesday, 1/26 at 3:12 PM EST (18 minutes before closing) with a $165 strike price call option expiring 2/12 for $4,430.

The next day, I checked my phone at 8:08 AM PST (11:08 AM EST), and sold for $23,970. Netting $19,540 in 3 hours of market hours.
