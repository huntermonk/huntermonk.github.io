title:  "One decision. $92.7k. ðŸ’°"

On February 13th, 2019 [I wrote a post](http://huntermonk.com/2019/02/13/interviewing-part-4.html) telling everyone how I chose working at Facebook over Uber. It was a coin flip for me.

As of today, choosing Facebook over Uber made me **$92,720 in one year**. It is, by far, the best financial decision of my life.

# The Offers
I actually thought I was leaving money on the table. My Uber recruiter gave me a range of expected IPO share prices. Anywhere from $45-67 per share. That range seemed plausible.

January 18th, 2019 was when I officially accepted my offer. At this point, [$FB](https://www.google.com/search?q=%24FB) was at a historical low of $150.04, due to [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal).

Based on these prices, with state income tax included (Uber team was in Seattle, WA, with no state tax), the Uber offer was worth $25,036 more in the first year. I also thought Uber had better growth potential. Here is the CA state tax:

# Fast Forward, 10 Months
Today, Uber's employee lockup ends. It's been 6 months since their IPO and their stock has been on a continual decline.

Their price is now at a [record low](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-06/large-uber-block-trade-is-said-to-price-as-ipo-lockup-expires), $27.05. Facebook's stock happens to be doing well, and is now at $192.04:
