title:  "Unmute and laugh. 🎙"
---

All your meetings are probably video conferences now. 

If you're in a meeting of `<= 4`, you, of course, **should mute** when you're not talking. Leaving yourself unmuted creates echoes, background noise, and clearly shows your disdain for the speaker.

However, you **should unmute yourself to laugh**.

## When to Unmute

As we have more and more videoconference meetings, there's a clear lack of levity. Especially in larger meetings. 

I believe that's due to two things:
1. The speaker doesn't get the audible feedback of a laugh when they make a joke.
2. Listeners don't hear laughs from other people - it's not clear that they should laugh.

### Feedback from Listener ➡️ Speaker
If a speaker makes a joke and doesn't hear anything back, it hurts the speaker's ego. Even just subconsciously.

That creates a negative cycle. After a no-laugh, the speaker is less likely to make jokes, the audience becomes less interested, speaker gets less positive feedback, and on.

### No Laughs from Other Listeners
Hearing a laugh from the audience prompts additional laughing. The first time I talked about this with my team, the response I got was:

> Yes but you can see people laughing + smiling silently.

That's true, but that's the equivalent of someone smiling when you tell them a joke to your face. It's not the same as something audible. We have all said a joke to someone where they've softly smiled or said, "that's funny". It's just not the same.

Also, laughing begets more laughing. The response I get when I say this is some stupid shit like:
1. I'm an independent thinker, I laugh because I want to.
2. I hate laugh tracks on TV shows.

Get over yourself. Laughing from peers causes you to laugh whether you're aware of it or not. It's why:
1. Standups aren't given to an empty room.
2. Watching funny movies with your friends is better even if you're not talking to each other.

**TL;DR: Unmute yourself to laugh in big meetings and you will have a 10x better experience.**
