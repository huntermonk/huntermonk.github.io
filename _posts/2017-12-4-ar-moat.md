title:  "Creating an AR Moat."

To create a defensible business, you need [a moat](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp). In software, that's often a network effect, like Facebook and Google have. 

The more people join Facebook, the more useful it becomes. Every search on Google makes it better at returning accurate results.

AR information tied to the real-world is a possible moat. A (bad) example of this is user-generated reviews displayed over a store viewed in AR.

Every person who looks at reviews on the Louis Vuitton store makes the underlying AR engine better at recognizing that particular store, because now it has a new viewpoint of it.

Creating a company that makes an AR moat is the only moat I see myself well equipped for.

It also seems like a company I can apply to [YC](http://ycombinator.com) with, although I don't have a co-founder or real business plan.
