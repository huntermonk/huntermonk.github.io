title:  "2019 books. ðŸ“š"
---

I [moved to the Bay Area this year, 2019](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10156292404976243&id=589661242&sfnsw=cl).

I don't enjoy much here on the weekends, so I read a lot. This year I read 46 books. It comes out fairly close to one a week.

Some books need to be print, most are good on Kindle, and a small amount are good as audio books. I had a queue for each of these formats this year.

I'm going to start marking when I finished the book. I'll add a date at the end (i.e. (12/22)).
