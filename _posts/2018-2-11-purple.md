title:  "(40H) Purple, video effects - 19.08h. üçá"
---

I released another 40 hour project this weekend, [Purple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/purple-3d-effects-more/id1341380172?mt=8). It adds AR effects to video, most notably video effects grabbed from green screen videos.

I was inspired by the Tobias Van Schneider [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/035-tobias-van-schneider-of-semplice) podcast episode. He talks about being paralyzed about releasing something because he is too focused on doing it perfectly.

Instead, he suggests going for something "really stupid". So for this project, I focused on keeping it really stupid. The project filename is actually `stupid.xcodeproj`.

Interestingly, I finished the app in around 10 hours. The remainder of the time was dealing with Apple rejections. It was rejected for using emoji in the effect selector table, and for including an AR effect of Drake dancing in [Hotline Bling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxpDa-c-4Mc).

I strongly disagree with both of those rejections. You can just check Twitter to see the reactions to emojis being rejected, so I won't expand on that.

I also disagree with the Drake rejection, but I'm less confident about it. If you download the app, you can see that I turned off the Drake animation for the review, and have re-included it. Morally, I'm not sure how I feel about misleading the review team, but I fundamentally disagree with the original rejection.

I feel that I'm strengthening his brand. The most likely case is that nobody downloads this app, so it doesn't matter. The other outcome is that it is downloaded often, people post videos dancing with that recording, which strengthens his popularity.

I'm not sure if that's correct, so it's possible that my mind on that may be changed. Either by myself, or due to outside events.
