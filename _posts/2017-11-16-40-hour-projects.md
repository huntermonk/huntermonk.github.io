title:  "40 hour projects."
---

I've finished the 7-Eleven project and moved to Los Angeles, so I finally have time to work on personal projects.

There's quite a few ideas I want to try out, so I want to limit myself to just 40 hours of work before I release or demo something. Once I get to that release/demo moment, I will write a post with screenshots of how exactly I spent my time, since I'll be tracking my time just as I do when contracting.
