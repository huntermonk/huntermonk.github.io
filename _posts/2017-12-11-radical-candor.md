title:  "Radical candor."
---

After completing a proficiency test for a client, he gave me unemotional, accurate feedback. It was helpful to hear, and I could act on it in future work.

He ended our feedback conversation with something to the effect of:

> I hope that you and I can continue working in an environment with radical candor.

I really like the phrase "radical candor". Since that conversation, I've tried to apply radical candor to all aspects of my life, not just business.

So far it has caused positive effects, but it's too early to tell.
