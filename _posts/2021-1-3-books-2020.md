title:  "Books of 2020. ðŸ“š"
---

[Like in 2019](http://huntermonk.com/2020/01/02/2019-books.html), this year I kept a list of books I read and the mediums I read them in. 

Math + charts do well on paper, but not on Kindle. I prefer Kindle - if it's a story format and/or light, I'll do audiobook.

If there is a date after the item, it's when I completed it (i.e. (12/22)).

This year I completed 23 books.
