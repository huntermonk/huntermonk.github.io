title:  "iFly AR Game."
---

I partnered with [T-3](https://www.t-3.com) to work on this [AR game](https://www.t-3.com/thinking/t3-blends-indoor-skydiving-with-augmented-reality-to-create-immersive-gaming-experience/) for [iFly](https://www.iflyworld.com).

Our goal was to elevate iFly to an amateur competition, similar to what [Topgolf](https://topgolf.com/us/) did for driving ranges. It seems inevitable and obvious.

Unfortunately, I moved to LA during this project, and was unable to finish it. It looks like the T3 team did a fantastic job.
