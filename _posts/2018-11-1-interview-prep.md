title:  "Prepping for interviews."

I'm currently prepping for [FAANG](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp) interviews. They all have very specific, academic interviews.

The questions are along the lines of:

> Write a function that returns a `Bool` representing if an array of strings can be combined to create a target string.
> For example, given `["one", "two", "cat", "dog"]` and a target string of `"onecat"`, return `true`.
> ```
> "oneonecat" // true
> "dogtwo" // true
> "dotwo" // false
> "onetwothree" // false
> ```

You write out your answer on a whiteboard, speaking aloud in a pair-programming style.

These questions are esoteric and rarely used in real-life. They're covered in the seminal book, [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=dp_ob_title_bk).

I'm learning how to solve these algorithmic questions using a unique iPad-only flow. I keep the iPad in split-screen with [InterviewCake](https://www.interviewcake.com) on the left and [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) on the right.

Then I switch to Notes.app when I want to do the "whiteboarding" step.

I'm thinking of posting these playgrounds so others can use them when prepping.
