I was just sent this:

![Me studying for Facebook interviews, 2 years ago](/img/studying.jpg)

That's me studying for my first Facebook interview, two years ago!

I was an economics major, so I was missing the core CS concepts needed for an interview. 

I failed that interview. I had two weeks to study. I could've pushed the interview out. I didn't. 

But now, I received that pic while I was at my desk on FB campus! ðŸ¤ª
