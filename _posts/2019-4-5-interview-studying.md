I was just sent this:

![Me studying for Facebook interviews, 2 years ago](/img/studying.jpg)

That's me studying for my first Facebook interview, two years ago!

I only had about two weeks to study for my interview - I didn't think I could push it out far enough to give me enough studying time. I definitely could have.

I didn't do CS in college, so I was missing most of the core concepts needed for the interview. I didn't get an offer at that time of course.

But now, I received that pic while I was at my desk at on FB campus! ðŸ¤ª
