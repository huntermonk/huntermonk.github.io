A couple of days ago, the keys on my brand-new MBP stopped working. I had to buy a duplicate laptop ($3k+) while Apple took 5 business days to fix it.

They made up for it - they added a made-up free repair, Non-Focus Video. My camera was totally fine. They basically replaced the entire top half for free.
