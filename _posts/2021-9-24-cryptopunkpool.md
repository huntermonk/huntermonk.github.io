Currently, my friends [Jake Bailey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakebaileyentrepreneur/)) and colleagues at FB are pooling together money to buy a [CryptoPunk](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks). They are the most highly valued set of NFTs.

We are targeting mid-tier punks, which are valued at around 150Œû ($450,000). Currently, we have pooled together around $300k.

I created a landing page, [CryptoPunkPool.com](http://www.cryptopunkpool.com) for others to join. Feel free to contribute.
