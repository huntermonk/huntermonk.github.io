An extremely underappreciated tool is the "no update", update. 

An easy trap to fall into when someone is waiting on you to complete something, and it's delayed, is to think that if they are upset, it's because it's not getting completed fast enough. Or the right way.

Taht'st true some of the time, but IMO 85% of the pain of the delays is not the delayed outcome, it's not trusting that it's being actively worked on. It's also thepain of having to use up brain space to keep thinking about it.

Depending on the person, the latter cost can be even higher. As long as you know it's actually being worked on and pushed forward, if you trust the ability of theperson doing the task, you can't make them smarter or faster. But you can make sure they're actually doing it.

Maintaining the following in your brain takes up a lot of space:
1. What are the tasks on my plate?
2. For the tasks that are delegated, who owns it?
3. If someone else owns it, is the ball in my court our theirs?
4. If in their court, what is the status?
5. If status is unclear, or update is expected at this point, when was the last time I requested an update?
6. Am I exceeding my social capital or adding to frustrating by asking again?
7. (if get to this point) cost of having to ask and/or explain why need to ask.

I find that when people get angry in these situations, it's actually much more about resentment for taking up brain space having to think about the problem. Less so about the actual outcome.

All of this can be ameliorated by simply continually updating the task master on a regular basis. Crucially, that means updating them, even if you are messaging them to say "there is no update or change. will update again by 5PM EST tomorrow."

You will find that people are **far** more receptive to those delays because they know:
1. I do not have to keep brain space open to monitor this person.
2. Clearly, this person understands their responsibilities.

Get over the fear of delivering a "no update" update. You and your counterparties will be much happier.
