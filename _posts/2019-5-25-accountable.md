I like to do [30 Day Challenges](http://huntermonk.com/2018/04/29/30-day-challenge.html) where I have an accountability partner.

If my 30 day challenge is to go to the gym every day, I have to take a picture of myself in the gym and send it to my partner. My partner will have a similar sort of task to do every day and send.

[Last time](http://huntermonk.com/2018/05/13/30-day-challenge-update.html), at the end, I created a [nice GIF](http://huntermonk.com/2018/05/31/30-day-challenge-complete.html) of all the pictures I took.

I'm writing an app to enforce this.

Enter your email and I'll let you know when it's ready:
<form action="https://formkeep.com/f/27f4ec694f19"
      accept-charset="UTF-8"
      enctype="multipart/form-data"
      method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="utf8" value="‚úì">

  <label for="email-address">Email Address</label>
  <input type="email" id="email-address" name="email">

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

## Accountable
All it does is let you pair up with a friend. Each of you has to upload a picture of you doing your challenge (can be whatever, gym, studying) every day, for 30 days. 

Here's a day where we both did our gym challenge:

![gym challenge](/img/accountable/both.png){:height="812px" width="375px"}

All you can do is upload a pic/vid of you achieving your challenge, and see what your friend has uploaded.

If you forget, you see a frowning face to remind you to get your shit together.

At the end of your 30 day challenge, you get a nice compilation of y'all's uploads and a chart showing who did the best.

## Why Am I Doing This
Skip if uninterested.

Facebook [does not fuck around](http://huntermonk.com/2019/05/02/so-far-at-fb.html) when they say "Move Fast and Break Things". I want to get better at building stuff in the fastest way possible. I'm forcing myself to make some side projects as quickly as I can. I don't care if no one uses them, or if existing apps do it.

I time all the work I do. At this time of writing, I've worked on this project 10.25 hours. I'd like to have this shippable in under 40 hours.
