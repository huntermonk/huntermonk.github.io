### Expected Change
On Sunday, March 7th, [I wrote how I expected the BTC market to react](http://huntermonk.com/2021/03/07/bitcoin-rise-from-stimulus.html) to the [1.9 Trillion Stimulus Bill](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/05/stimulus-explainer-basics-checks-unemployment-taxes-spending/) getting passed. In summary:

> I think Bitcoin will reach an all-time high (ATH) in the next 5-14 days because of the stimulus bill. 

### Result
Bitcoin hit a new ATH right inside the 5-14 day window.

Six days later on Saturday, March 13th, around 2:10AM PST, Bitcoin broke through it's previous ATH of $58,330.

Later on in the day around 12:40PM PST, it led to a new ATH of $61,782.76.

## The Trade

In the [original post](http://huntermonk.com/2021/03/07/bitcoin-rise-from-stimulus.html) I laid out three reasons for making that belief public. The third was:

> This promotes a culture of accountability. (not being Jim Cramer, making predictions he never verifies)

On top of that, I don't want to just make price predictions and verify them; I need to put money where my mouth is. (putting [skin in the game](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/0141982659/) can change behavior)

#### Monday
So, the next day, Monday morning at 7:12AM, I bought 20 BTC at an average price of $50,804.90 per coin. ($1,016,098.00 in total)

_Note that this exchange uses an international date format, so 08/03/2021 is March 8th, 2021 + timezone is incorrect._

This was by far my largest asset purchase to date. I had extremely high conviction, so I actually was able to sleep well at night.

As soon as I made the purchase, BTC continually rose in price over three days.

During some of the pullbacks, I added to the position, eventually making the total position 30 BTC (~1.5M USD).

#### Wednesday
On Wednesday, [the House voted to approve the stimulus bill](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/stimulus-house-vote-03-10-21/index.html). However, it wasn't going to be signed by the President until that Friday.

At that point, BTC was near the previous ATH of ~$58,330. I sold 20 of the 30 BTC with the intention to re-buy in a few days. 

_The final three columns (left-to-right) are: buy price, exit price, profit in BTC._

That sale locked in a 1.856 BTC ($103,925.98) profit just two days after the purchase. 

#### Thursday + Friday
Thursday night and Friday morning, I begin buying again.

Eventually, the total gets back to 30 BTC.

#### Saturday Morning

As mentioned at the top of this post, at around 2AM PST, BTC shoots past the ATH. 

At 5:13AM, a friend on the east coast wakes me up with a text about the price change. I then sell 25/30 BTC:

### In Total

The two trades above + minor ones through the week resulted in a **3.676 BTC realized profit** in six days.

![summary](/img/btc-trade/in-total.png)

At time of writing, I still have 5 of the original 30 BTC still open with an unrealized gain of 0.349 BTC.

In total, that's a **4.025 BTC (or $246,330) profit in six days.**

This is my best trade yet. My next step is to build resilience to *not* trade until I have that very high level of conviction again.
