title:  "Tic-Tac-Toe. ðŸ‘Ÿ"
---

For one of our in-class [Outco](www.outco.io) assignments, we had to create a tic-tac-toe game for the command line. I was paired with [Avinash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beavinash).

I had never made a Swift command line app, and it was incredibly easy. We made an entire working game with error handling, instructions etc. in 90 minutes.

You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/huntermonk/tic-tac-code). I need to add a GIF of what the play looks like, but I'm on mobile at the moment.

I feel very empowered to make developer tools for myself. I highly encourage you to make a Swift command line app (that retains state) if you haven't before.
