title:  "Interest Rate Arbitrage Performance. ðŸ’¹"
---

A few days ago, I [wrote about my plan for interest rate arbitrage](http://huntermonk.com/2021/02/02/interest-rate-arbitrage.html).

I'm going to publish periodic updates displaying the performance of this strategy, starting with $100k. 

**Return YTD: 0.97%**

I'm using $100k for easy performance measurement. 

Although my starting value is different, I'm going to use the exact same data from my position / DeFi moves, so that 100k invested at 1/1/2021 is exactly what see above.

_This pulls from my own personal data._
