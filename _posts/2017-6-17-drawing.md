title:  "Drawing ✏️"

So far, my favorite part of [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/) has been drawing in mid-air. It would be cool to send these drawings to friends who can see it at same scale in-air.

I don't draw very much, and raising up your phone to view a message is too much friction for this to be a general consumer product. It would still be fun to make, though.

Here's a demo
