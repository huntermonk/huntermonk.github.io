title:  "Interest Rate Arbitrage Performance Pt. 3: Why are interest rates so high? ðŸŒ´"
---

Previously I [wrote about my interest rate arbitrage method](http://huntermonk.com/2021/02/06/publish-interest-rate-performance.html).

To recap, a bank savings account [gives you 0.01% interest](https://www.chase.com/personal/savings/savings-account/interest-rates).

Lending out [USDC](https://www.coinbase.com/usdc) or [USDT](https://tether.to/) (crypto coins that are guaranteed to always be worth $1 per token), you can earn something like 14.18% right now.

## Why is that?
There are two reasons:

1. If you're bullish on crypto, it's better to get a collateralized loan against your crypto than to sell it.
2. When [volatility is high](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/), traders increase leverage to speculate, and are willing to pay more.

### Better to get a loan than sell
Using Bitcoin (BTC) as an example.

Everyone is encouraged to [never sell](https://twitter.com/GoingParabolic/status/1359238749062856704) Bitcoin. Even Warren Buffett says he buys companies he plans to [never sell](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-only-reason-sell-174218068.html).

But if I never sell my Bitcoin or stock, how do I use it to buy stuff?

You get loans against your assets as collateral. 

Right now, [volatility of Bitcoin is very high](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/).

A few days ago, I [wrote about my plan for interest rate arbitrage](http://huntermonk.com/2021/02/02/interest-rate-arbitrage.html).

I'm going to publish periodic updates displaying the performance of this strategy, starting with $100k. 

**Return YTD: 0.97%**

I'm using $100k for easy performance measurement. 

Although my starting value is different, I'm going to use the exact same data from my position / DeFi moves, so that 100k invested at 1/1/2021 is exactly what see above.

_This pulls from my own personal data._
