title:  "Interest Rate Arbitrage Performance Pt. 3: Why are interest rates so high? ðŸŒ´"
---

Previously I [wrote about my interest rate arbitrage method](http://huntermonk.com/2021/02/06/publish-interest-rate-performance.html).

To recap, a bank savings account [gives you 0.01% interest](https://www.chase.com/personal/savings/savings-account/interest-rates).

Lending out [USDC](https://www.coinbase.com/usdc) or [USDT](https://tether.to/) (crypto stable coins that are guaranteed to always be worth $1 per token), earns you something like 16.99% right now.

Meaning, if you have 100k in cash and store it at Chase for a year, at the end of the year you'll have $100,010. Using Fulcrum (pictured above), you would have $116,990.
## Why the huge gap?
There are two reasons:

1. If you're bullish on crypto, it's better to get a collateralized loan against your crypto than to sell it. Lots of people want these loans.
2. When [volatility is high](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/), traders increase leverage to speculate, and are willing to pay more.

#### 1. Better to get a loan than to sell
_Using Bitcoin (BTC) as an example, but this applies to all non-stablecoins and assets._

Everyone is encouraged to [never sell](https://twitter.com/GoingParabolic/status/1359238749062856704) Bitcoin. Even Warren Buffett says he buys companies he plans to [never sell](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-only-reason-sell-174218068.html).

But if I never sell my Bitcoin or stock, how do I use it to buy stuff? The answer is: **you get loans against your BTC (assets) as collateral**.

That is [a collateralized loan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateralization.asp). 

For example, [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/) will loan you $10k at a 9.75% interest rate if you put up 0.43 BTC ($20,321 at time of writing) of collateral. Meaning, if you don't pay back your loan, they will begin selling parts of your BTC to pay for your loan.

So, why is paying that 9.75% better than just selling BTC to pay for life? A hypothetical:

- A retired BTC holder has $256k of BTC. He lives a $120k / year lifestyle.
- To pay for his life, he can sell $120k worth of BTC each year.
- But, he pays the [15% long-term capital gains tax](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates) if he sells. (assuming the best case here, that he held the BTC over a year)
- That means, to actually get $120k after tax, he needs to sell $141,176.47 of BTC.
- This costs him $21,176.47 (taxes).
- At the end, he has $114,823.53 worth of BTC left.

With a collateralized loan:
- He puts up $240k in BTC to BlockFi.
- Gets a loan for $120k at 9.75%.
- Over the year, it costs him $11,700.
- To cover that, he sells $13,764.71 of BTC (has to pay for long-term capital gains).
- This costs him $2,064.71 in taxes.
- $2,064.71 is $19,111.76 less than the taxes in scenario #1, **but he still has $242,235.29 worth of BTC!**

This second scenario is **massively** better. It's $242,235.29 - $114,823.52 = $127,411.77 better.

You can make this example even more dramatic by making him pay short-term capital gains in scenario #1, and accounting for the increase in value of BTC this year. (will do in future post)

#### 2. High volatility
In the above example, the lender is only getting 9.75%. How can the lender afford to give out 16.99%?

The more fickle but higher margin source of revenue for lenders is on margin trading. When volatility increases, more people want to speculate. [Volatility of Bitcoin is very high](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/).

As of writing, people will pay 21.06% to speculate long on BTC:
