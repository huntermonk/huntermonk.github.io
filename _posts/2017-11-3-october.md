title:  "My best month, October. ðŸŽƒ"
---

October was my highest grossing month to date. I brought in $36,117 and spent $14,731, resulting in $21,386 in net income.

This was largely due to timing of payments for my regular service. If I was accounting on an accrual basis, this would be a regular month.

Nonetheless, I want to celebrate this milestone.
