title:  "Augmented reality + live video = great checkout. ☺️"
---

I made a prototype of how live video could be combined with augmented reality during the checkout process for a **much** more interactive experience for a buyer.

Essentially, you can have someone from the company doing a live broadcast about the product you are purchasing. This works especially well for product launches, like the launch of the new iPad.

Viewers can ask questions just like in an Instagram Live, with the top questions rising to the top. The broadcaster can then address those questions, achieving *much* more leverage than if they were simply responding via chat. There is significant overlap on what questions are asked via chat, and the broadcaster can address 340 people with the same question at once.

Here's the demo.
