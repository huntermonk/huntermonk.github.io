title:  "30 Day Office + Gym Challenge: Complete."
---

My 30 day challenge is done. I missed 9/30 days which is fairly disappointing. I was doing a good job not missing any until Memorial Day weekend started, where I missed a large block.

I think it was still generally a good idea to do this, it helped keep me focused, and if I didn't have the challenge, I would've missed far more days.

Everyday that I attended the office and gym, I took pictures of myself at both to prove I was there. I compiled most of those pictures into a GIF below.
