title:  "Facebook interview."

Today is my technical interview with Facebook. A week ago, a technical recruiter from Facebook found me via LinkedIn and emailed me.

Oddly enough, about a week before the email, I asked an acquaintance, [modocache](http://modocache.io), what he did to prepare for his interview with Facebook. He recommended [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=R563JB8S32EPZQNKVDRA).

So, for the past week I've been studying that book along with basic data structures in Swift, since FB interviews tend to revolve around that. I didn't study computer science in school, so my knowledge of those subjects is fairly weak.

I'll come back to update this after the interview, which is at 12:30PM CST.
