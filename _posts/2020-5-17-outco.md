[Outco](https://www.outco.io/) is a FAANG-style interview prep program. I attended it starting in November of 2018. It was a major factor in my ability to get [several offers from tech companies](http://huntermonk.com/2019/02/13/interviewing-part-4.html).

_This post will only lightly touch on the content of Outco - you can get that from their website. This is about my unbiased experience._
# About Outco

Outco is a [5-week program](https://www.outco.io/faq). You can pay for it in 3 ways:

If I remember correctly, classes are from 6-9PM PT. There is additional homework every day. It's a tough program, but it works.

# Interview Prepping
#### By Myself
In September of 2018, my last iOS contract wrapped up. I decided I would give myself 3 months to study for interviews and take a job at a large tech company. I planned to begin interviewing in December of 2018.

I did the normal things. I read [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and practiced on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). I bought a 6' wide whiteboard to simulate the interview environment.

In the middle of October, I was halfway through my 3 month studying hiatus. I wasn't *even close* to interview-ready.

I'm not sure if I wasn't ready due to slow learning ability, lack of discipline or a combination of those. But I wasn't going to be ready by December. I looked into Outco, and decided to join.

#### With Outco
I wanted to join FAANG companies or companies of similar comp. Namely Uber + Facebook. On [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/), for the level I was targeting (E4 at FB), salary is around $160k (RSUs are also around $150k for a total comp of $310k/year, but Outco only counts salary). If I got a job with 160k salary, the Outco packages would work out as:

- $0 upfront + (0.1 * 160,000), **$16,000** ‚ùå
- $1,500 upfront + (0.05 * 160,000), **$9,500** ‚ùå
- $5,000 upfront, **$5,000** ‚úÖ

$5,000 upfront was the clear winner, so I went with that.

#### Starting the Program

The program is **hard**. ~~Luckily, I saved up~~ I planned ahead for this, so I had money saved up to cover me for 3 months. I didn't have a full-time committment, so I could go to all the office hours + do every homework exercise. 

If you attempt to do Outco with a full-time job, clear everything from your weekends. It will be very hard to do otherwise.

Around the end of week 2, there was a huge difference in my interview performance. I could see it was going to go well.

# Interviewing Starts
Outco helps you schedule your interviews. I ended up having around [12 interviews with 10 teams](http://huntermonk.com/2018/12/10/interviewing-part-1.html).

As Outco suggests, I put my most desired companies at the end. That accomplished two things:
1. I got my nerves out of the way!
2. When my initial interviews poked holes in my interviewing ability, I could fill them up for later interviews.

I end up with [a few offers](http://huntermonk.com/2019/02/13/interviewing-part-4.html). I begin negotiating them, which is another place Outco really adds value.

# Negotiating Offers
As detailed in [this post](http://huntermonk.com/2019/02/13/interviewing-part-4.html), my offers mainly came down to Uber and Facebook.

At this point, Uber is pre-IPO. Given the estimated range of their IPO price, the offer Uber gave is much higher than Facebook's. Especially given that the Uber position is in Seattle, Washington, where [there is no state tax](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0210/7-states-with-no-income-tax.aspx).

Outco's COO, [David Hopper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dphopper/) helps talk me through the negotiation and decision between these two companies. He pushes me towards Facebook - I'm quite sure if he wasn't there I would've chose Uber.

Choosing Facebook over Uber ends up grossing me an additional $92.7k in my first year, as [detailed here](http://huntermonk.com/2019/11/06/one-decision-92k.html). By far one of my best financial decisions.

# Overall Assessment
Choosing Outco was a hugely positive decision for me. Even if I excluded the Uber and Facebook decision (that is a rare situation), that $5k is a drop in the bucket. If I get one additional question right during the interview, that's another $20k I can add to my signing bonus. 

It's absoutely worth it. I highly recommend it.

#### Caveats
1) At first, I was embarassed to tell my colleagues that I took an interview prep class. It felt a bit like cheating.

On the other hand, I didn't do computer science in college. CS classes at UT Austin are much more expensive, and much longer. Outco was my very mini version of a CS degree. That feels ok.

2) It may not be the right program if you are targeting a company with lower pay. From a pure ROI perspective, the cost may not be worth it. However, I believe the lifetime value far outweighs the cost regardless of where you work.
