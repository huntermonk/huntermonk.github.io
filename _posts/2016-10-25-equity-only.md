Very often, I get requests like: 

> "I've got this idea we can do and we will just split it down the middle, 50/50. I'll do the business work and you do the coding."

This is a really unfair request, and can be a little rude. I have to say no to an average of **one of these a week**, and inevitably the person asking gets personally offended.

The problem is not with your idea, it's that success is [all in the execution.](http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html) For most ideas, the coder will be executing for something like 3-6 months before any _real_ business can start.

An analogous request would be to approach a home builder and give this proposition:

>"I've got a great idea for an apartment complex - I have it all planned out. The project is pretty large, so I'm guessing it'll be 3-6 months of work until we get our first set of renters.
>
During that time I'll be placing ads and finding retail partners for our first floor.
>
This complex will take a lot of work, so we'll both be working at least 60 hours per week.
>
We will split the revenue 50/50. If we sell it in 7-10 years, we will split the proceeds from the sale 50/50 then too."

No home builder would go for this - and it's a way better proposition than starting a software company.

A home builder is selling a product with known demand & sales of the company/apartment complex happen all the time. When you're starting a software company, you don't even know what you're building, much less if people will want it.
