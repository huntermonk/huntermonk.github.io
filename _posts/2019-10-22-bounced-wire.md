In January 2014, I was rapidly building up the number of spaces in our portfolio at [M-Spaces](www.m-spaces.com). As a refresher, we would lease apartments, furnish them, and then exclusively use the apartment to host guests on AirBnB or other [STR portals](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNTDsD_iVh2gesjioFBfcfgSvo1p9A%3A1569217094170&ei=RlqIXeWGCsH5-gSfhpHwAQ&q=+short+term+rental+str&oq=+short+term+rental+str&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l8j0i30l2.2192.6602..6707...6.2..2.320.4203.7j7j7j2......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i67j0i13j0i8i7i30j0i13i30j0i5i30.0vibRUadlCE&ved=0ahUKEwjlweSbnebkAhXBvJ4KHR9DBB4Q4dUDCAs&uact=5).

We had over $1M ARR across 22+ luxuy spaces. At one point, we had the most reviews of any host on AirBnB, and I won the [Entrepreneur of the Year award at UT Austin](http://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2014/03/06/three-honored-at-ut-entrepreneurship-awards-for-2014/). 

I was in contact with Mark Cuban at the time. Was by far the most helpful investor I ever had. I don't think a single email I sent went without a reply for longer than 3 hours. Even stupid little things:

He agreed to a $150k convertible note with a million dollar cap. In hindsight, I obviously should've asked for more. They wired it to my bank account.

During the wire transfer, I had a walk with [Bob Metcalfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe). He said "Don't count the check until it's in the bank account." At the time, I thought it was hilarious. I disagreed with Bob a few times, and I was wrong each time.

4 days later,the wire bounces! The name on the wire was for M-Spaces and the name on the bank account was Monk Group, a general LLC I used for a broad range of business. M-Spaces was still being incorporated in Delaware.

This is exactly what happens to Richard Hendricks in the [first episode of Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series))

That blow was enough for Stephen, Mark's portfolio manager that I was working with. He backed out of the deal, and eventually Austin passed a law that essentially requires you to own the spaces that you're hosting from, so I shut M-Spaces down. We still have a good relationship, so I'll probably work with Mark again in the future.

Ultimately, Mark made the correct decision. I don't think the 150k wouldn't have affected the incoome.
