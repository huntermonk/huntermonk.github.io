title:  "Deals fall through."

In January 2014, I was rapidly building up the number of spaces in our portfolio at [M-Spaces](www.m-spaces.com). We got over $1M ARR! (As a refresher, we would lease apartments, furnish them, and then exclusively use the apartment to host guests on AirBnB).

I was in contact with Mark Cuban at the time. Was by far the most helpful investor I ever had. I don't think a single email I sent went without a reply for longer than 15 minutes.

He agreed to a $150k convertible note (in hindsight, I obviously should've asked for more). They wired it to my bank account.

During the wire transfer, I had a walk with [Bob Metcalfe]. He said "Don't count the check until it's in the bank account." At the time, I thought it was hilarious.

The wire bounces! The name on the wire was for M-Spaces and the name on the bank account was Monk Group, a general LLC I used for a broad range of business. M-Spaces was still being incorporated in Delaware.

This is exactly what happens to Richard Hendricks in the [first scene of Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)#Season_1)

That blow was enough for Stephen, Mark's portfolio manager that I was working with. He backed out of the deal, and eventually Austin passed a law that essentially requires you to own the spaces that you're hosting from, so I shut M-Spaces down. We still have a good relationship, so I'll probably work with Mark again in the future.

Ultimately, Mark made the correct decision. I don't think the 150k wouldn't have affected the incoome.
