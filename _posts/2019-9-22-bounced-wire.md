In January 2014, I rapidly built up the number of spaces in our portfolio at [M-Spaces](www.m-spaces.com). As a refresher, we would lease apartments, furnish them, and then exclusively use the apartment to host guests on AirBnB or other [STR portals](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNTDsD_iVh2gesjioFBfcfgSvo1p9A%3A1569217094170&ei=RlqIXeWGCsH5-gSfhpHwAQ&q=+short+term+rental+str&oq=+short+term+rental+str&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l8j0i30l2.2192.6602..6707...6.2..2.320.4203.7j7j7j2......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i67j0i13j0i8i7i30j0i13i30j0i5i30.0vibRUadlCE&ved=0ahUKEwjlweSbnebkAhXBvJ4KHR9DBB4Q4dUDCAs&uact=5).

We had over $1M ARR across 22+ luxury spaces. At one point, we had the most reviews of any host on AirBnB, and I won the [Entrepreneur of the Year award at UT Austin](http://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2014/03/06/three-honored-at-ut-entrepreneurship-awards-for-2014/) when I was 21.

_That 4.6 rating still hurts, lol._

I was in contact with [Mark Cuban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban) at the time. He was by far the most responsive investor I ever had. I don't think a single email I sent went without a reply for longer than 3 hours. The median response was <7 minutes.

He agreed to a $150k convertible note with a million dollar cap. In hindsight, I obviously should've asked for more. They wired it to my bank account.

While I was waiting for the wire transfer to clear, [Bob Metcalfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe) went on a walk. I clearly remember him saying:
> Don't count the check until it's in the bank account. 

At the time, I thought it was hilarious. The transfer had already been sent.

I disagreed with Bob a few times, and I was wrong each time.

4 days later, the wire bounces! The name on the wire was for M-Spaces, and the name on the bank account was Monk Group, a general LLC I used for a broad range of business. M-Spaces was still being incorporated in Delaware, so I didn't have a bank account in its name.

This is _exactly_ what happens to Richard Hendricks in the [first episode of Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)). His check is for $200k instead of $150k. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That blow was enough for Stephen, Mark's portfolio manager that I was working with. He backed out of the deal.

Eventually, Austin passed a law that requires you to own the spaces that you're hosting on, so I shut M-Spaces down. We still have a good relationship, so I'll probably work with Mark again in the future.

Ultimately, Mark made the correct decision. I don't think the $150k wouldn't have affected the outcome.
