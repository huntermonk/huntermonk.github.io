In [Part 2](http://huntermonk.com/2021/01/20/working-hard-pt-2.html), I showed the script I'm using to stay on track for my goal of 2,800 hours of work in 2021.

Today, I'm _finally_ on track for at least 2,800 hours:

That's crazy. I only missed the first 20 days of the year (was still working 40 hours a week then), and it took all the way till now. Two months later.
