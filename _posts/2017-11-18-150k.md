Today, I saved up $150k.

My post about [reaching $100k](../../04/26/100k.html) was only 7 months ago, which is exciting. That means I'm saving ~$7,143 per month.

On October 22nd, 2017, I moved to Los Angeles. The cost of living is higher here, and my apartment is 2.36x the cost of my previous one. Also, I stopped all of my contracts, so I don't have any income at this point.

Because of those factors, I'm guessing this will be my high savings point for a while. I'm ok with that.
