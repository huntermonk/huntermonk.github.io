title:  "Arbitrage strategy: barely averted."

Previously, I wrote a three part series about [a plan for interest rate arbitrage](http://huntermonk.com/2021/02/11/why-so-high.html).

The goal was to get tradfi loans at the prevailing 3-4% rate, and lend it to crypto earn products earning 8-16%. Services like BlockFi, Celsius, Gemini and others.

That was not a good idea. Earning 8-16% like I thought was not sustainable. Every one of those failed.

In what I thought was the final post of the series, I described how I thought those earn products generated revenue:

>1. If you’re bullish on crypto, it’s better to get a collateralized loan against your crypto than to sell it. Lots of people want these loans.
>2. When volatility is high, traders increase leverage to speculate, and are willing to pay more.

#1 is earning interest by issuing overcollateralized loans, and #2 is providing margin for traders.

It turns out that even if earn products were doing some of that, that was not sufficient to produce adequate returns.

Luckily, I was able to withdraw from all of these products, so I did not incur any losses from this strategy.

I don't have a moral of the story or new insight. I just am stating for public record that I was wrong in those posts.
