title:  "Per-project pricing, aligning incentives. ðŸ“ˆ"

The vast majority of iOS contract work is billed on a [per-hour](http://hire.soff.es) basis.

Software is hard to estimate. Also, during the building process, you often learn new things about the product along with the client. Your learnings cause you to make revisions, extending the timeline.

Those two factors lead to per-hour billing.

_However_ per-hour billing does not align the contractor and client's incentives. The contractor is incentivized to bill more hours on things that may not impact the project's success.

I've done a good job of being conscious of this bias. To totally eliminate this bias, **I'm switching to per-project billing.**

In the beginning, I'm sure I will underestimate the work needed. Eventually I'll become more accurate. Because I have a [full-time job now](http://huntermonk.com/2019/02/13/interviewing-part-4.html), I have more freedom to make billing mistakes.
