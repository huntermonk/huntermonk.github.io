# Context
My favorite part of working at Facebook has been being an intern manager for four interns (one [group of three](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1PXN73hyX-xnMtEBVLpzEs_2kkkky4i7Xsq2Y0/) and [one individual](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5OriiPF8EcPBlq1kk-aCAoxY7x0jYrVXJEgn00/)). Specifically, I enjoy watching them get "beginner gains" on their technical coding skills. When you're new, your rate of learning is very fast.

I want to get more of that, so I chose to mentor kids in the area who are interested in coding. 

Also, it seems like people who volunteer are really happy. Maybe this will improve my life.

# The Schools
There are two schools near me, [Belle Haven Elementary](http://bellehaven.ravenswoodschools.org/) and [Mid-Peninsula High School](https://www.mid-pen.org/).

I thought, "Ok good. These schools are close, so they will be similar. I get one middle school and one high school, so that will provide some variation." In fact, they are not similar at all and age has nothing to do with it.

#### Belle Haven

Belle Haven appears to be a fairly poor public school. The facilities are run down. It seems that it's a requirement that teachers are Spanish + English bilingual. 

A significant portion of the students' parents only speak Spanish. An overlapping percentage (I wasn't told the exact percent) also don't have any internet connection at home.

#### Mid-Peninsula
On the other hand, Mid-Peninsula is a private school where the tuition is at a minimum, **$42,946** ($41,096 tuition + activities fee of $1,850 for returning students).

It is a well maintained, small school. It appears to have a very low student to teacher ratio.

# Contacting the Schools

#### Mid-Peninsula
I email Henry at Mid-Pen asking if there's a way I can help out.

He promptly responds. Henry is the wrong person, but he connects me to their Vice Principal. I end up doing an [interactive talk, titled How the Internet Works](https://www.facebook.com/589661242/videos/10157154414936243/?sfnsw=cl) for the school's tech week. I will write about the talk in a later post.

#### Belle Haven
Next, I contact Belle Haven. **First**, I call the number listed on Apple Maps (`(650) 561-3331`). It's disconnected.

**Second**, I go to [their website](http://bellehaven.ravenswoodschools.org/) to email them. There is no email address, but their contact form is broken:

**Third**, I call the number on their website (`(650) 329-2898`). It's broken, and has this bizarre recording. It replays forever:

/audio/belle-haven.mp3

**Fourth**, I go to Belle Haven in person. I walk in the lobby and before I say anything, the receptionist says “you subbing?” and flips this binder on the table open at me. Very curt. 

I respond with:
> I’m interested in coming in for an hour or two each week to help tutor your kids who are interested in coding.
>
> Do y’all have a program for this? If not, how can we start one?

It's clear she is annoyed I'm interrupting her work. She does give me the principal's email address, though. 

I email the principal - I get a single response, and nothing after that.

# The Chances of a Student at Belle Haven 
It's just incredible how much less of a chance Belle Haven students have. They don't have internet, their school is not interested in outside help. 

Their students need mentoring more than ones from Mid-Peninsula, but it's hard to give that to them.
