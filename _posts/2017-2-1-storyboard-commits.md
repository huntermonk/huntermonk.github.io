One annoying part of using storyboards is merge conflicts. The conflicts are exarcebated by the fact that each time you look at a storyboard, it changes.

You can help avoid conflicts by only committing the changes you actually need. 

To do that in Xcode while committing, just select the check/cancel button on the commit. Like this:

![Storyboard commit](/img/storyboard-commit.gif)

Leave it checked for the changes you actually want, and uncheck everything else.

I hope that helps.
