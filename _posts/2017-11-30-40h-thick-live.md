I've added live streaming capabilities to Thick.

That picture is a livestream of myself in front of green screen, up to a server, down to my phone and displayed by ARKit.

This is a bit harder than pre-recorded, because all the chroma settings have to be applied quickly to reduce latency.

Live camming has both sides of the marketplace (performers and audience), and also clear monetization strategies.
