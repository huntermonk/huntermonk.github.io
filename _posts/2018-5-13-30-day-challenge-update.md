title:  "30 Day Office + Gym Challenge: Update."
---

So far, I've only missed one day of my 30 day challenge (I missed it yesterday).

It has been a resounding success. Approximately 40% of the days, I would've missed the gym or missed the office if I wasn't doing this. I'm really impressed with my results, and I'm going to "re-up" on the challenge once our challenge expires.

On Sunday, May 6th, I split with my partner of many years. It has been an incredibly painful experience, but I feel blessed that I happened to set up this challenge for myself beforehand. This past week would've been tough without the structure that the challenge has added.

I'm only two weeks into the challenge, but I'm very happy I did it.
