title:  "The problem with books, revisited. ðŸ“š"
---

I [previously wrote]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-4-19-problem-with-books %}) about the problem with books. Really, the post is about consuming information through one medium.

A few weeks previous that post and up until now, I was actively avoiding books. I'm not sure if that's long enough to have a good experiment, but I've now started reading again. I think, my problem with books was that it was causing me to not trust my own thoughts about personal issues (technical books for example, do not create the same problem).

That hiatus was nice, but I'm reading again. I'm being extra conscious about what are truly my thoughts and what are thoughts that I'm pulling from another source.
