title:  "Live Hologram."

I'm still working on holograms. Today, I got live broadcasting to semi-work from OBS, up to Youtube, and down to an iOS device.

As visible in the video, there's still green screen lines showing. I have a theory this could be fixed using depth data from iPhones with dual cameras, eliminating the need for a green screen.

**Update**

Now the mask and opaque video are perfectly in sync. Any green lines you see are remnants from bad lighting or not setting broadcast settings correctly. Those problems are solvable.
