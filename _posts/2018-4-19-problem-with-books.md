The problem with books is: only the type of person who would write a book will write a book.

A book author is a very specific type of person. It's someone who is willing to work alone for long periods for uncertain reward. They're almost always quite literate. They skew "nerdy".

That means you're unable to read from the non-authors of the world, which are of course the vast majority. For example, Kanye West, an extremely influential artist, is a non-reader.

_From [Kanye](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/can39t-read-me-nothing/):_

> ‚ÄúSometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and so self-absorbed. I am not a fan of books. I would never want a book‚Äôs autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books.‚Äù

He is quite unlikely to write a book, and I know I am unlikely as well.

Because of this observation, for the past month, I've made a conscious effort to stop reading books/blogs, and attempt to learn through other means. That almost certainly accounts for the lack of posting for the last month.

I don't have a conclusion for this, but my hope is that I develop a more multi-faceted understanding of the world by learning through other mediums.
