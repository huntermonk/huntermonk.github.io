title:  "Trading money for time. üí∞‚è±"
---

I'm running an experiment on myself right now. I'm choosing to trade money for time whenever I can.

That means: using [Fin](www.fin.com) to do any virtual assistant work, always getting food delivered instead of walking to Chipotle (much less making it myself), taking Uber instead of driving, etc.

Because I just purchased [a vehicle](https://www.instagram.com/p/Be4SOEsDdP3/?taken-by=huntermmonk), I only have ~$75k in my bank account. That makes spending money on productivity a little scarier.

My hope is that money spent on productivity/learning early on in your career will pay dividends later on.
