I'm available on a contract basis for `Swift iOS` development, specializing in most types of video ([static](http://www.zapsapp.com), [3D](http://www.zapsapp.com), live).

If you're interested in starting a new project with me, or just need some help with anything `iOS`, send me [an email](mailto:hunter.monk@gmail.com), call at 817-914-4411, or send me a tweet at {% include icon-twitter.html username="huntermmonk" %}.

Here's a quick recap of some of the iOS projects I've worked on recently:

# ZAPS ‚ö°Ô∏è

[ZAPS‚ö°Ô∏è](http://www.zapsapp.com)lets you create what is basically a public snapchat story for any location. It's like Yik Yak with video.

# Walk-in Theater üìΩ

[Walk-in Theater](http://www.walk-in-theater.com) creates a 3D environment that you can "walk through", and enjoy spatialized audio playing from multiple 2D video panes.

>Walk-in Theater‚Ñ¢ is an experiment with peripatetic perspective, engaging participants' proprioceptors and spatial memory to orient themselves as they navigate among multiple video streams in a 3D sound field.

>Departing from one-way linear cinema played on a single rectangular screen, this multi-channel virtual environment pursues a cinematic paradigm that undoes habitual ways of framing things, employing architectural concepts in a polylinear video/sound construction to create a kind of experience that lets the world reveal itself and permits discovery on the part of visitors.

>Improvising on techniques of polylinear perspective long explored in Japanese painting and landscape design, Rachel Strickland's [Emptiness Can Hold Things](http://www.spontaneouscinema.com/?p=244) establishes a new vocabulary for the cinematic construction of a sense of place. Cycle By is the first of six Kyoto location studies in this interactive video series. Amidst intervals and thresholds of an urban landscape, at the confluence of two rivers there is a parallel universe perceived by bicyclists. The scene on any spring weekend unrolls like a picture scroll.

* **Sound Design** - Jim McKee
* **Interactivity** - Eric Gould Bear
