# [Walk-in Theater](http://www.walk-in-theater.com) üìΩ

In [Walk-in Theater](http://www.walk-in-theater.com), you get to experience a 3D environment that you "walk through", and enjoy spatialized audio playing from multiple 2D video panes.

![Walk-in Theater displayed on the iPad](../img/wit.png "Walk-in Theater displayed on the iPad")

>Walk-in Theater‚Ñ¢ is an experiment with peripatetic perspective, engaging participants' proprioceptors and spatial memory to orient themselves as they navigate among multiple video streams in a 3D sound field.

>Departing from one-way linear cinema played on a single rectangular screen, this multi-channel virtual environment pursues a cinematic paradigm that undoes habitual ways of framing things, employing architectural concepts in a polylinear video/sound construction to create a kind of experience that lets the world reveal itself and permits discovery on the part of visitors.

>Improvising on techniques of polylinear perspective long explored in Japanese painting and landscape design, Rachel Strickland's [Emptiness Can Hold Things](http://www.spontaneouscinema.com/?p=244) establishes a new vocabulary for the cinematic construction of a sense of place. Cycle By is the first of six Kyoto location studies in this interactive video series. Amidst intervals and thresholds of an urban landscape, at the confluence of two rivers there is a parallel universe perceived by bicyclists. The scene on any spring weekend unrolls like a picture scroll.

* **Moviemaker** - Rachel Strickland
* **Sound Design** - Jim McKee
* **Interactivity** - Eric Gould Bear

# Puppy üê∂ or Bagel üç© üë∂üèº

I had a challenge for myself to create and submit a game to the app store in 8 hours. On the day of the challenge, a [puppy or bagel meme](http://twistedsifter.com/2016/03/puppy-or-bagel-meme-gallery/) blew up on the internet, made by [teenybiscuit](https://twitter.com/teenybiscuit?lang=en).

It's an album of puppies and bagels and it's hard to determine which is which üòã.

In the game, you have to tap either all the puppies or all the bagels in a short amount of time. That's it üòõ
