In January 2014, I was rapidly building up the number of spaces in our portfolio. (As a refresher, we would lease apartments, furnish them, and then exclusively use the apartment to host guests on AirBnB).

I was in contact with Mark Cuban at the time. Was by far the most helpful investor I ever had. I don't think a single email I sent went without a reply for longer than 15 minutes.

He agreed to a $150k convertible note (in hindsight, I obviously should've asked for more). They wired it to my bank account. 

It bounced! The name on the wire was for M-Spaces and the name on the bank account was Monk Group, a general LLC I used for a broad range of business. M-Spaces was still being incorporated in Delaware.

That blow was enough for Stephen, Mark's portfolio manager that I was working with. He backed out of the deal, and eventually Austin passed a law that essentially requires you to own the spaces that you're hosting from, so I shut M-Spaces down. We still have a good relationship, so I'll probably work with Mark again in the future.
