### I am currently **unavailable** for engagement.

I live in Austin, working on various technical projects.

I previously worked on a contract basis, focusing on Swift iOS development, specializing in Augmented Reality work. I've also done a considerable amount of work with video ([static](http://www.zapsapp.com), [3D](http://walk-in.theater), and live).

Personal Timeline ‚è≥
---
_Note: This is the timeline of my business life and not relevant to contract work._

I became an entrepreneur at a very young age.

In **2008**: I started helping companies outsource their work to the Philippines and other countries. Simultaneously, in **2009** I started search engine consulting. In **2012**, I founded my first true startup, Frolic.

In August of **2013**, I started my first venture, [MSpaces](www.M-Spaces.com). We provided a variety of fully furnished living for temporary stays in Austin.

In the beginning of **2015**, I started [ZAPS](www.zapsapp.com), my first iOS app. ZAPS allowed you to post what is similar to a snapchat public story for every location (_your school has its own story, the bar downtown does etc._).

Since then, I've done freelance work as an iOS engineer. Most of the projects tend to focus on video (live, static, 3D, etc.), but I've worked across many domains.
